title: "RWM102: Algebra"
course_description: "This course discusses how to use algebra for a variety of everyday tasks, such as calculate change without specifying how much money is to be spent on a purchase, analyzing relationships by graphing, and describing real-world situations in business, accounting, and science."

**Unit 4: Inequalities** <span id="4"></span> 
*You probably use inequalities, just like equations, in everyday life
without thinking about it.  Every time you go to the store, you need to
decide whether you have enough money to pay for the items you need to
purchase.  The inequality you need to solve is the* Amount of Money has
to be GREATER than the Total Cost of Items.  *In this unit, very similar
to Unit 2*: *Equations, you will generalize the procedure for solving
inequalities.  You will learn that an* inequality*is a statement and its
solution is a set of numbers that makes this statement true.  You will
explore which properties of inequalities are the same and which are
different from the properties of equations.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 5.25 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above.  You can read the
    HTML webpage or download a PDF version of the text by clicking on
    the appropriate link at the bottom of the page.  Read the text until
    the section titled “The Algebra of Linear Inequalities.”  This part
    of the text is an introduction to linear equalities.  As you can see
    from the given examples, inequalities are very similar to equations,
    except that they state that one expression is smaller (or greater)
    than another, rather than equal.  
      
     Reading this text should take approximately 15 minutes.
