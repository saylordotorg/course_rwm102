**Unit 8: Operations with Polynomials** <span id="8"></span> 
*In this unit, you will become familiar with a special type of algebraic
expressions, called a polynomial.  A* polynomial*, as opposed to a
monomial, is an expression that contains two or more terms.  (The word*
poly *means* many *in Greek.)  Usually the polynomials you will work
with will look like x*<sup>5</sup> + 2*x*<sup>3</sup> + *x* + 2, *or
similar*.  *Polynomials have various special properties that you will be
analyzing in the future math courses.  In this course, you will learn
how to recognize, classify, add, subtract, multiply, and divide
polynomials.  You will apply the skills of combining like terms and
using distributive property in order to perform these operations.  These
skills are helpful when you are dealing with the motion of two or more
objects*: *for example, when you need to calculate when and where one
runner will overtake another runner.  For another example, these skills
are useful if you need to know how much interest you are earning from
two or more savings accounts.*

    expressions of various degrees and number of terms.  Then, you will
    work through two examples of adding and subtracting two polynomials.
     You will notice that all you have to do to add or subtract
    polynomials horizontally is open the parentheses (in case of
    subtraction) and combine like terms.  This video also contains an
    example of applications of polynomials in geometry.

**8.3.2 Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial** <span
id="8.3.2"></span> 
*Note: When you multiply polynomials, you have to distribute each term
of the first polynomial over the second polynomial, which means you have
to multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second
polynomial.  The resources in this sub-subunit will show you various
techniques for keeping track of all the resultant terms.  The
multiplication result will usually contain like terms, which can be
combined.*

**8.3.2.1 Multiplying Binomials (FOIL)** <span id="8.3.2.1"></span> 
*Note: When you multiply a binomial by a binomial (two terms by two
terms), your result will have to have four terms.  Sometimes two of
these terms will be alike, and you will have to combine them to simplify
the result.  Depending on the binomials you are multiplying, the final
result might be a binomial, a trinomial, or a four-term polynomial.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire

    basic binomial multiplication problems on this webpage in order to
    gain mastery and to be able to do these types of problems quickly.

**8.3.2.2 Special Products of Binomials** <span id="8.3.2.2"></span> 
*Note: Special products of binomial are the results of the following
multiplication:  
*

-   *Multiplying a binomial by itself (in other words, squaring it):*

(a ± b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> ±2ab +b<sup>2</sup>  
  
 *A trinomial in the form of a trinomial on the right-hand side of the
above formula is known as a* complete square trinomial*.*  
-   *Multiplying the binomials that are the sum and difference of the
    same terms:*

(a – b)(a + b) = a<sup>2</sup> – b<sup>2</sup>  
  
 *A binomial in the form of a binomial on the right-hand side of the
above formula is known as a* difference of two squares.  
  
 *These formulas, sometimes also called* classic quadratic*formulas, are
important to remember.  Recognizing when they can be applied is a
necessary skill for this and many other higher-level math courses.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above.  You may also
    download a PDF, mobi, or ePub version of this text by clicking on
    the appropriate link under “Download.”  Scroll down to the Practice
    Set, and solve problems 7–21.  This set of problems contains
    exercises involving multiplying polynomials with any number of
    terms.  Some of the problems involve multiplying three polynomials.
     In this case, multiply any two of the three polynomials first and
    then multiply the third polynomial by the simplified result. Once
    you have completed the practice problems, check your answers against
    The Saylor Foundation’s [“Answer Key to CK-12: Andrew Gloag, Anne
    Gloag, and Melissa Kramer’s Basic Algebra: CK12 Editors’ ‘Chapter
    9.2: Multiplication of Polynomials’ Problems
