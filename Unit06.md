**Unit 6: Systems of Linear Equations and Inequalities** <span
id="6"></span> 
*You have seen in Units 2 and 5 that linear equations in one variable
usually have 1 solution and linear equations in two variables have
infinitely many solutions.  What would happen if two linear equations in
two variables had to be solved together?  That would mean that a pair of
numbers would have to satisfy both equations at the same time.  This
pair of numbers would be the solution of a* system of linear equations*.
 Some of the mixture problems from Unit 3 could be solved by setting up
a system of linear equations, because they involve two given
relationships between two variables.  In this unit, you will learn three
different methods of solving systems of linear equations and use them to
solve a variety of world problems.  You will also find solutions of
systems of linear inequalities in two variables and to apply them to
real-life situations.  For example, if you want to determine the price
for and amount of two types of candy for a party, you have the
constraints of the total amount of candy needed (GREATER than a given
amount) and the amount of money you can spend (LESS than the amount you
have).  The quantities of two types of candy you buy have to satisfy
both constraints.  In this unit, you will learn how to identify all the
possibilities for similar problems.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above. You may also download
    a PDF, mobi, or ePub version of this text by clicking on the
    appropriate link under “Download.” Read the entire text, and watch
    the videos embedded in the text.  (You may skip Example B, as you
    have already seen it in sub-subunit 6.1.6.) This reading discusses a
    variety of real-world situations which can be described by systems
    of linear equations. Note that some of these systems can be
    inconsistent or dependent, and you will learn to interpret what this
    means in the context of the given situation.  After reading,
    complete practice problems 1–10. Once you have completed the
    practice problems, check your answers against The Saylor
