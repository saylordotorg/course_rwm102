**Unit 7: Operations with Monomials** <span id="7"></span> 
*Starting with this unit, you will work with expressions that consist
mostly of letters (variables) and do not seem to have very much to do
with numbers.  You will see how the rules governing operations with
these expressions arise from the properties of operations with numbers,
particularly distributive property and order of operations.  This unit
focuses on expressions called* monomials*.  These are expressions that
contain only one term (recall from Unit 1 what “term” means).  The fact
that* monomial *contains the Greek word* mono*, which means* one*, can
help you remember this definition.  For example, expression ab is a
monomial, but a + b is not, because it contains two terms.*

**7.1 Algebraic Exponential Expressions** <span id="7.1"></span> 
*Note: You are already familiar with the concepts of exponents and
powers from arithmetic.  In this subunit, you will review it,
emphasizing the odd and even powers of signed (positive or negative)
numbers.  Then, the concept of exponents will be applied to variables
and variable expressions.*

Product** <span id="7.2.1"></span> 
*Note: In this sub-subunit, you will learn about these three rules of
exponential expressions:*

-   *to multiply powers of the same base, ADD the exponents;*
-   *to raise a power to another power, MULTIPLY the exponents; and*
-   *to raise a product to a power, EACH factor of the product has to be
    raised to this power.*

**7.2.3 Negative Exponents** <span id="7.2.3"></span> 
*Note: In this sub-subunit, the definition of a power will be extended
to include negative exponents.  While this might seem counterintuitive
(one cannot multiply a number by itself a negative number of times),
there is a way to raise a number to a negative power by taking a
reciprocal of the same number raised to a positive power.  You will
learn why this definition makes sense and learn to apply it to simplify
exponential expressions.*

    negative exponents as well.
