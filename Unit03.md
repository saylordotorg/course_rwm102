**Unit 3: Word Problems** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will apply the skill of solving equations you
mastered in Unit 2 to solve various types of word problems.  When you
encounter a word problem, you have to remember to read it carefully and
think critically about what quantity you are asked to find, what
quantities are known, and what the relationship is between them.  This
will help you set up an equation that will give you an answer to the
problem.  For example, if you know the discounted price of an item and
need to find the original price, remember that the percent of the
discount is taken from this original price, which is something you do
not know!*  
  
 *You probably already know how to solve some of the problems covered in
this unit, such as percent problems or uniform motion problems that can
be solved by one arithmetic operation.  However, you will now approach
these types of problems from the algebraic point of view, which will
enable you to move on to more complex problems.  In these problems, you
cannot just add/subtract and multiply/divide the quantities given and
arrive at the answer.  These problems can only be solved by setting up
an equation.*

**3.4.2.2 Solving Percent Mixture Problems** <span id="3.4.2.2"></span> 
*Note: The problems in this section involve mixing two solutions with
different concentrations of a certain substance.*

    2”](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/systems-of-eq-and-ineq/v/mixture-problems-2) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, and
    take notes.  While different in context, algebraically this problem
    is similar to mixture problems in sub-subunit 3.4.1.  Note the steps
    Sal Khan takes to choose a variable, translate all the information
    given into algebraic expressions, and set up an equation.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, and
    take notes.  This is another example of a percent mixture problem.
     This time, the percent concentration in one part of the mixture is
    unknown.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above.  This interactive
    applet will guide you one step at a time through setting up the
    table you need to solve a typical percent mixture problem.  This
    website focuses only on the type of problems in which amounts of
    both solutions being mixed are unknown.  Try to go through at least
    three problems to achieve proficiency.  
      
     Solving these practice problems should take approximately 45
    minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above.  This website will
    help you solve various mixture problems (including the ones
    involving percents) one step at a time.  Try to solve at least five
    problems or more, if necessary.  You can also click on “More
    information on Money and Mixing Problems” at the bottom of the page
    to see more examples of mixture and percent mixture problems.

**3.4.3 More Uniform Motion Problems** <span id="3.4.3"></span> 
*Note: The problems in this sub-subunit still require the use of the
uniform motion equation that you used in subunit 3.3; however, these
problems cannot be solved by just applying the formula.  You will have
to express all given information algebraically as well as set up and
solve an equation.*

     Instructions: Please click on link above, watch the video, and take
    notes.  In this problem, two objects (cyclists, in this case) are
    traveling in opposite directions toward each other.  Note how Dr.
    Sousa uses the table to organize all the information given in the
    problem.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on link above, watch the video, and take
    notes.  In this problem, there is only one traveler, but she travels
    to another city and then back.  Again, a table is useful to organize
    all the information given.  Note that the task here is to find the
    distance, but the variable chosen to be denoted, *x*, is the time it
    takes to complete a one-way trip.  You will find that this is a
    convenient approach in most problems where time is not given
    directly.

     Instructions: Please click on link above, watch the video, and take
    notes.  In this example, two people travel in the same direction and
    one has to catch up to the other.  Note that the key information you
    need to set up the equation is not given in the problem explicitly:
    both people will have traveled the same distance by the time one
    overtakes the other.
