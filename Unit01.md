**Unit 1: Variables and Variable Expressions** <span id="1"></span> 
*When most people think of math, they think of numbers.  However, with
this math course, you will be working with letters.  In algebra, letters
are used to represent numbers.  These letters are called* variables*,
because* *the numbers they represent may vary.  For example, if you are
paid $10 per hour, your salary can be expressed as* 10*×*h*, where*
h *is the number of hours you have worked.  You can change the number
that letter* h *stands for according to your particular case in order to
calculate your salary.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn that the properties of numbers apply to
letters as well, and you can use them to work with expressions
containing variables.  One of the main skills you have to master in this
unit is recognizing* like terms*, because you can add and subtract them
as if they were numbers.*

     Order of operations agreement is a convention used by
    mathematicians to ensure that expressions with many operations are
    always evaluated the same way, which is consistent with the
    properties of operations. Because we are used to reading from left
    to right, it is natural to add and multiply in the same direction,
    instead of thinking which operations should be performed first. With
    practice, you will get used to the correct order and will read the
    expressions accordingly.  
        
     Work through examples A and B and Guided Practice problem 1. 
    Complete practice problems 1–7. Make sure to watch the “Order of
    Operations” video embedded in the text. The rest of the examples and

*Note: The definition of a term was already introduced in the reading
assigned in sub-subunit 1.1.2.  Here, you will learn about like terms.*

-   **Reading: All Math Words Encyclopedia: David McAdams’s “Like
    Terms”**
    Link: *All Math Words Encyclopedia*: David McAdams’s [“Like
    Terms”](http://www.allmathwords.org/en/l/liketerms.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the
    encyclopedia entry.  Note that the like terms have the same
    variables in the same exponents but might have different numerical
    coefficients.  You will need to recognize like terms in order to add
    and subtract them, which you will do in sub-subunit 1.3.2.2.  
      
     Reading this entry should take approximately 5 minutes.

    Terms”](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/solving-linear-equations-and-inequalities/v/combining-like-terms) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, and
    take notes.  This video explains in detail why and how the terms
    defined as *like* can be added and subtracted.  This is a basic
    algebraic tool which you will be using throughout the course.  It is
    important to understand that terms that are not like terms cannot be
    combined together.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    webpage.  Removing, or *opening*, the parenthesis is another
    algebraic tool that allows you to work with expressions that contain
    parenthesis even when the variables inside them cannot be combined.
     Click on the “new problem” button at the end of the article to try
    a practice problem, and then select the “check your answer” button.
     Continue this process by clicking on “new problem,” and solve 10
    problems.  You can also create a worksheet of 10 problems by

    Property”](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/solving-linear-equations-and-inequalities/v/combining-like-terms-and-the-distributive-property) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, and
    take notes.  In general algebraic expressions, you will need to open
    the parenthesis and then combine the like terms.  Due to commutative
    and associative properties, you can move the like terms around in
    order to combine them.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, and
    take notes.  Dr. Sousa explains a few slightly more complicated
    examples of simplifying algebraic expressions.  Note that the last
    example in the video contains parenthesis within brackets.
     According to the order of operations, you need to first remove the
    inner grouping symbol of parenthesis and then simplify the
    expression within the brackets.
