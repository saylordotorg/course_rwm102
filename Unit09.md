**Unit 9: Factoring Polynomials** <span id="9"></span> 
*Factoring, the procedure you will learn to perform in this unit, is
multiplication in reverse*: *instead of multiplying two polynomials, you
will need to write a given polynomial as a product of two or more
different expressions.  Factoring is an important tool that you will use
in solving quadratic, and, later, higher degree polynomial equations.
 Quadratic equations occur a lot in problems that involve rectangular
objects and their areas*: *planning gardens, framing photographs,
carpeting the floors, and so on.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    webpage.  Reading and understanding algebraic expressions, much like
    translating sentences from a foreign language, is a skill that takes
    time to develop.  Prior to learning how to factor an algebraic
    expression (that is, to write the expression as a product), it is
    essential to have fluency in distinguishing which parts of the
    expressions are multiplied and which are added/subtracted.  This
    reading provides a useful review of how to identify which algebraic
    expression is a product of several factors and which one is a sum of
    several terms.

**9.1.2 Rewriting Polynomial as a Product of a Monomial and a Different
Polynomial** <span id="9.1.2"></span> 
*Note: Now that you have practice identifying common factors, you can
begin to factor polynomials by rewriting them as a product of a common
factor and another polynomial.  This process, as Dr. Burns points out
below in “Factoring Simple Expressions,” is the result of the
distributive property of real numbers applied in the opposite
direction*: *instead of multiplying a number by a parenthesis, you will
be writing the given result as a product of a number and a parenthesis.*

pairs).  Not all polynomials can be factored this way.  This technique
will be applied to factoring quadratic trinomials later in sub-subunit
9.3.2.2.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the first 6
    minutes of the video, and take notes.  Note the steps taken to
    factor a four-term polynomial.  

    -   Separate the polynomial into two groups of two terms.
    -   Identify a common factor in each of the group and factor it out.
    -   Check that the resultant expressions contain a common binomial
        factor.  If they do not, then the polynomial cannot be factored,
        at least not when the terms are grouped this way.
    -   Factor out a common binomial factor and rewrite the polynomial
        as a product of two binomials.

trinomials of the form* ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c: *using trial factors
(also known as* guess and check*) and by grouping (also known as* ac*,
or* bridge *method).  You will try out both methods and can use a
preferred method in the future.  You will also develop a sense of when a
trinomial can be factored instantly by guessing and when this would take
a long time and factoring by grouping is a better choice.*

     Try factoring trinomials using this method: click on the “new

     After answering the problem, click on the “check your answer”
    button.  Continue this process by clicking on “new problem,” and

    problems by clicking on the button at the bottom of the page titled
    “Click Here for a Randomly Generated Worksheet and Answers.”  The
    answers will be provided at the end of the worksheet.  
      
     While Dr. Burns points out in this reading that listing all trial
    factors and checking their products can be tedious, some trinomials
    can be factored fairly quickly using this method.  For example, if
    either *a* or *c* or both are prime, their only factors are 1 and
    itself, and this limits the number of trial factors.  Also, if *c*
    is positive, both binomial factors will have to contain the same
    sign, and this limits the number of trial factors as well.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above. You may also download
    a PDF, mobi, or ePub version of this text by clicking on the
    appropriate link under “Download.” Work through Example E.  In this
    example, the issue of factoring a trinomial with *a* = -1 is avoided
    by factoring (-1) out. Then, the resultant trinomial has the form of
    x2 + bx + c and can be factored as such. Then, work on practice
    problems 13–16 and 18. Once you have completed the practice
    problems, check your answers against The Saylor Foundation’s

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, and
    take notes.  In this video, a quadratic trinomial with negative *a*
    is factored by grouping.  If it seems a bit confusing to do it this
    way, you can avoid it by factoring (-1) out, as was done in the
    previous example.  Then, the resultant trinomial can be factored
    either using trial factors or by grouping, and a negative sign will
    remain in front of the final product.

**9.4 Special Factoring** <span id="9.4"></span> 
*Note: Recall from sub-subunit 9.3.2.2 that the products of some
binomial result in special kinds of polynomials, called* complete square
trinomial and difference of two squares*.  Because you are working on
factoring, which is a procedure inverse to multiplying, and you are
given a polynomial that looks like a* complete square*or* difference of
two squares*, the polynomial can be factored immediately with the help
of* classic quadratic*formulas (used in the reverse direction):*  

-   *a*<sup>2</sup>± 2*ab* +*b*<sup>2</sup> = (*a* ± *b*)<sup>2</sup>
-   *a*<sup>2</sup>– *b*<sup>2</sup> = (*a* – *b*)(*a* + *b*)

*There also will be two new special factoring formulas introduced in
this subunit, known as* sum and difference of two cubes:  
-   *a*<sup>3</sup>+ *b*<sup>3</sup> = (*a* + *b*)(*a*<sup>2</sup> –
    *ab* + *b*<sup>2</sup>)
-   *a*<sup>3</sup>–  *b*<sup>3</sup> = (*a* – *b*)(*a*<sup>2</sup> +
    *ab* + *b*<sup>2</sup>)

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, and
    take notes.  In this example, the *difference of two squares*
    formula is applied twice in order to factor the expression
    completely: once to the original polynomial, and then to the new
    binomial factor.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, and
    take notes.  This is an example of an interesting polynomial that
    can be attempted to be factored either by using the *difference of
    two squares* or *difference of two cubes* formulas.  Whichever one
    you choose, the resultant factors can still be factored further
    using another special binomial factoring formula.  In this video,
    the *difference of two squares* formula is used first.  As an
    exercise, try an alternative method (e.g. applying *difference of
    two cubes* first) and try to show that the results will in fact be
    the same.

**9.6 Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring** <span id="9.6"></span> 
*Note: In Unit 2, you learned how to solve all kinds of linear
equations, or equations where the highest degree of the unknown variable
is 1.  In this subunit, you will be introduced to one of the methods of
solving quadratic equations, or equations where the highest degree of
the unknown variable is 2 – factoring.  Factoring breaks up a quadratic
equation into two linear equations.  Thus, a quadratic equation that can
be solved by factoring will generally have two solutions.*
