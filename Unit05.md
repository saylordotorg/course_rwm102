**Unit 5: Graphs of Linear Equations and Inequalities** <span
id="5"></span> 
*This unit is an introduction to graphing relationships between the two
quantities on the coordinate plane.  A graph helps visualize how one
quantity depends on another.  In this course, you will only graph
relationships that can be described by a linear equation, and their
graphs are always straight lines.  Graphing is an important tool that
aids in analyzing relationships, both in abstract and in applied math.
 The material in this unit will help you become comfortable with
graphing pairs of numbers on the coordinate plane and understand how the
equations and relationships can be represented by lines.  As an example,
you might want to graph how the location of a train depends on the time
since the train departed from the station.  If the train is moving with
constant speed, this graph would be a straight line.  The slant of this
line (which, as you will learn in this unit, is called the* slope) *will
depend on the speed*: *the greater the speed, the steeper the line.  If
the line is going up (looking from left to right), it tells you that the
distance is growing with time, which means that the train is moving away
from the station.  Otherwise, if the line is going down, it tells you
that the distance is decreasing, which means that the train is
approaching the station.  You will see that a lot of information about
the train’s journey can be gathered from just one graph.*

**5.2 Linear Equations in Two Variables** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*Note: Recall that in Unit 2 a* solution*of an equation was defined as a
number that make this equation a true statement.  A solution of linear
equations in 2 variables can be defined the same way, except now it is
a* pair *of numbers (one for each variable) that makes the equation a
true statement.  In this subunit, you will learn how to find these
solutions and represent them on a graph.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, take
    notes, and graph the line shown on graph paper.  This is also an
    example of graphing a linear equation written in the form *y* =
    *mx* + *b*, but the focus is on the fact that the coefficient in
    front of *x* is a fraction.  Because we can pick any values of *x*
    to generate the ordered pairs for plotting, it is convenient to
    choose the ones that will produce integer values of *y*, which are
    easier to graph.

    Khan again graphs a linear equation by generating its solutions.
     However, this time an extra step is required: the original equation
    needs to be rewritten with the variable *y* on one side and
    everything else on the other side, so values of *x* can be plugged
    in and the values of *y* can be easily calculated.

**5.4 Equations of Straight Line** <span id="5.4"></span> 
*Note: While working on subunits 5.2 and 5.3, you have probably noticed
that linear equations are usually written in one of these forms:*  

-   y = mx +b*, known* *as the slope-intercept form.  As you will learn
    in this subunit,* m *in this equation is the slope and* b*is the*
    y*-intercept.*
-   Ax + By = C*, known as the standard form.*

*There is also another possible form, used to write an equation of the
line with a given slope* m*passing through a given point
(*x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>*).  It is known as the* point-slope form:
*y* – *y*<sub>1</sub> = *m*(*x* – *x*<sub>1</sub>).  
  
 *In this subunit, you will be identifying the line’s properties from
these equations and converting equations from one form to another.*

**5.4.4 Writing the Equation of a Line Passing through a Given Point,
Parallel or Perpendicular to a Given Line** <span id="5.4.4"></span> 
*Note: You have learned about the special relationship between the
slopes of parallel lines and perpendicular lines in sub-subunit 5.3.2.
 Now that you know how write the equations of lines, you can write the
equations of the lines parallel or perpendicular to the given line.*

**5.5 Linear Inequalities in Two Variables** <span id="5.5"></span> 
*Note: Before starting this subunit, spend about 15 minutes briefly
reviewing Dr. Burns’ article “Introduction to Equations and Inequalities
in Two Variables” assigned in sub-subunit 5.2.1.*

**5.5.1 Graphing Linear Inequality of Two Variables on the Coordinate
Plane** <span id="5.5.1"></span> 
*Note: Recall that the solutions of a linear equation or an inequality
in two variables are ordered pairs of numbers that make the equation or
the inequality a true statement.  Both equations and inequalities in two
variables have an infinite number of solutions.  However, while all
solutions of a linear equation belong to one straight line, the
solutions of a linear inequality will take up an entire region on a
coordinate plane.  The following reading explains how to identify this
region and show it on the graph.*
