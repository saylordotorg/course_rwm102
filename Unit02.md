**Unit 2: Linear Equations** <span id="2"></span> 
*You, like other people, probably use equations in everyday life without
even realizing it.  Calculating a unit price to figure out which brand
is cheaper when making a purchase, converting inches into feet,
estimating how much time it would take you to drive to your destination
at a certain speed all involve solving equations mentally.  In this
unit, you will learn formal procedures for solving equations.  You can
probably recall the basic rules from the math courses you have taken in
the past.  In this unit, you will review these rules while focusing on
the formal logical definition of equation as a statement and its
solution as a number that makes this statement true.  You will apply the
skills from Unit 1 to simplify the sides of an equation before
attempting to solve it.  You will also work with equations that contain
more than one variable, and you will learn that because variables always
represent numbers, you can use the same rules to find the specific
variable you are looking for.*

    Linear Equations in One Variable”**
    Link: Connexions: John Redden’s *Elementary Algebra*: [“Solving
    Linear Equations in One
    Variable”](http://cnx.org/content/m18033/1.1/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above.  You may read the
    HTML webpage or download a PDF version of the text by clicking on
    the appropriate link at the bottom of the page.  Read the following
    sections: “Define Linear Equations in One Variable” and “Solutions
    to Linear Equations in One Variable.”  Then, scroll down to
    “Exercises,” and complete exercises 1–5.  Click on the “Show
    Solution” link for each problem to check your answer.  
      
     An important point to take away from this reading is that
    *equation* is defined as a statement (containing a variable), which
    may or may not be true, depending on the value of the variable.  To
    *solve* an equation means to find all the values of the variable for
    which the statement is true.  In the following sub-subunits, you
    will focus on finding these values.  
      
     Reading this section and solving the practice problems should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

    Variable”](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/solving-linear-equations-and-inequalities/v/example-of-solving-for-a-variable) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, and
    take notes.  A *formula* is an equation that expresses a
    relationship between two or more quantities.  When one of these
    quantities needs to be rewritten in terms of others, the formula
    becomes a literal equation.  
      
     In this video, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle
    (equation used to find a perimeter when its length and width are
    known) is solved for the width.  That is, the result is an equation
    used to find the width of a rectangle, when its perimeter and length
    are known.  Note that Sal Khan shows two different ways to arrive at
    the answer.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, watch the video, and
    take notes.  The formula shown in this video converts Fahrenheit
    temperature into Celsius.  Solving for Fahrenheit temperature
    results in a formula that converts Celsius temperature into
    Fahrenheit.  Note that there are two possible approaches to do this,
    but only one is shown in the video.  You might want to try the
    second approach (distribute 5/9 over the parenthesis) to see which
    one is more convenient.  
      
     Watching this video, pausing to take notes, and trying the second
    approach on your own should take approximately 15 minutes.
