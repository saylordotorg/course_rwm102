Course Syllabus for "RWM102: Algebra"
-------------------------------------

This introductory mathematics course is for you if you have a solid
foundation in arithmetic (that is, you know how to perform operations
with real numbers, including negative numbers, fractions, and decimals).
 Numbers and basic arithmetic are used often in everyday life in both
simple situations, like estimating how much change you will get when
making a purchase in a store, as well as in more complicated ones, like
figuring out how much time it would take to pay off a loan under
interest. The subject of algebra focuses on generalizing these
procedures.  For example, algebra will enable you to describe how to
calculate change without specifying how much money is to be spent on a
purchase--it will teach you the basic formulas and steps you need to
take no matter what the specific details of the situation are.
 Likewise, accountants use algebraic formulas to calculate the monthly
loan payments for a loan of any size under any interest rate.  In this
course, you will learn how to work with formulas that are already known
from science or business to calculate a given quantity, and you will
also learn how to set up your own formulas to describe various
situations by translating verbal descriptions to mathematical language.
 In the later units of this course, you will discover another tool used
in mathematics to describe numbers and analyze relationships: graphing.
 You will learn that any pair of numbers can be represented by a point
on a coordinate plane and that a relationship between two quantities can
be represented by a line or a curve. Units 6, 7, and 8 may seem more
abstract than the earlier ones, as you will deal with expressions that
contain mostly variables and not too many numbers.  While the procedures
you will master in these units might seem to have little practical
application, you have to keep in mind that they result in formulas that
describe very real situations in business, accounting, and science.
 Knowing how to perform various operations with algebraic expressions
will eventually enable you to solve quadratic and even more complex
equations.  You will explore a variety of real-world scenarios that can
be described by these kinds of equations.  For example, if a ball is
thrown up in the air, solving a quadratic equation will help you find
out when it will hit the ground.  As another example, if you know the
area of a rectangular garden, then you can use a quadratic equation to
find the length of each side.

 Also, please note that some webpages might take some time to load, as
many of the webpages contain a lot of mathematical symbols.  
  
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 You will need to complete the activities in each unit as well as the
Final Exam.  You will also need to complete:  

-   Sub-subunit 2.2.5 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 2.3.2 Assessment
-   Subunit 4.4 Assessment

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the resources, activities, and assessments in each unit.  
  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
**131.25 hours **to complete.  Each unit includes a time advisory that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.
 These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set
goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 6.75 hours.
 Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.3
(a total of 3.25 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions: **As noted in the “Course Requirements” section,
there is a prerequisite for this course.  It may be helpful to review
RWM101: Foundations before you begin this course.  
  
 Please make sure to take comprehensive notes as you work through each
resource.  Mark down any important equations, formulas, and definitions
that stand out to you.  These notes will serve as a useful review as you
study for your Final Exam.  
  
 **Common Core Standards**: In addition to listing course-wide and
unit-specific learning outcomes, this course also makes note of all
Common Core Standards that are covered by the learning material.
 Notations of these standards appear next to the learning outcomes with
